# Airdrop Survival (starter)

Simple starter project skeleton for a small pygame game.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

Install dependencies (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m src.main
```

Notes
- `assets/` is empty for now; put images/sounds there and load them in the code later.
- This is a minimal starter; extend collision, scoring, lives, and UI as needed.
